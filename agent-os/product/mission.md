# Product Mission: BADY

## Problem

Mobile gaming currently lacks high-quality, chaotic "couch co-op" experiences. While console games like *Overcooked* thrive on shared screens, mobile players are often isolated. BADY solves this by bringing the "shouting at your partner because the kitchen is on fire" energy to mobile devices, allowing friends to play together in the same room via local Wi-Fi or hotspot.

## Target Users

* **Casual Gamers:** People who enjoy "pick up and play" mechanics without complex tutorials.
* **Couples/Friends:** Looking for a shared activity (date night, hangouts).
* **Mobile-First Users:** Players who want console-quality gameplay without a console.
* **Ages:** All ages (E for Everyone), aiming for a broad appeal similar to Nintendo titles.

## Solution

1. **Global Culinary Humor:** We don't just cook burgers; we cook "The Best Food Around the Globe" with a funny twist. Recipes are unique, culturally diverse, and visually hilarious (e.g., "Angry Sushi" or "Rocket Kebab").
2. **True Mobile Native:** Unlike direct console ports, BADY uses a "Virtual Joystick + Action Button" scheme specifically tuned for touch screens, avoiding the "clunky" feel of virtual gamepads.
3. **Cartoon "Juice":** A specific focus on "Squash & Stretch" animation and "Bouncy" physics to make the chaos feel fun rather than frustrating.
